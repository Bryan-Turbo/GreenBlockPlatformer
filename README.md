# GreenBlockPlatformer
A small little platformer with a green block as the character.

## World
This <i>"game"</i> has no real purpose. It is just a stupid platformer with a world as big as the window, which cannot be scaled, for now at least. <i>I might change that one though</i>. <br /><br />
oh and it also <b>doesn't have any enemies</b>.
